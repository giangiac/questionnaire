# Write your own questionnaire!

This repo provides the Python class `Quest` which can be used to create your own questionnaire.

The questions are open-ended and responses are stored in a pickle file.

To save the responses of a user, he/she has to commit the updated `replies.pkl` file to the questionnaire repo.
